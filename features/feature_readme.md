# Feature Folder

Features are standard for Behave and Cucumber and there is plenty of excellent documentation on the Internet, but the steps directory with the all_steps.py file is super useful if you don't want too deep a directory structure within the features folder.

The environment.py file gives you a lot of control, if you understand how to use it.
